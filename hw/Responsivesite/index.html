      <h2> All About The Chef</h2>
<p> My name is kelby Norfleet, but i sometimes enjoy calling myself, Chef Kelboyardee. It sounds silly,
but theres a ring to it. There are a few things I love most in life, and that eating, and cooking.
i started cooking young, in the kitchen with my parents, or cooking when my mother had to work late.
I love to experiment and cook cuisines from different places, or trying to replicate something i ate at
restaurant </p>

    <div id="col3">
      <p>I also love to cook non conventional food, such as vegan food. But really good vegan food.
    One of my favorite things to make is cheesecake. I even started selling them about a year ago.</p>
