  <body> An important quote in my life is Where there is a will there is a way. I live to learn new things, especially those that will help
    me create, and run a successful business one day. I like to say that entreprenuers wear many hats. This explains why i have such varied experiences and skills.
    I am very open to learning new things, and am never intimidated by something i have no knowledge of. Lastly, its very important that i work somewhere that aligns with my own values and beliefs.
    I am plant based, and very inclusive, and therefore enjoy working for places that support diversity, and do not destroy the environment.
